    <h2>Common Misconceptions About Retirement Planning</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>I don't need to revisit my withdrawal rate</strong>
        <p>Many retirees believe a fixed withdrawal rate is sufficient, but it should be adjusted based on individual needs and market performance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Medicare will cover all healthcare costs</strong>
        <p>While Medicare provides essential coverage, it does not cover all expenses, leaving retirees with significant out-of-pocket costs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Security won't last</strong>
        <p>Concerns about Social Security's future are common, but it remains a vital source of income for many retirees and is unlikely to disappear.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I can work for as long as I need to</strong>
        <p>Assuming one can work indefinitely overlooks health issues and job market fluctuations that may necessitate early retirement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I'll spend less in retirement</strong>
        <p>Many believe expenses will decrease, but retirees often spend more on leisure, travel, and healthcare, leading to higher costs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Investing money is too risky</strong>
        <p>Some avoid investing due to perceived risks, but not investing can lead to missed growth opportunities, especially over the long term.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pensions are a bad investment</strong>
        <p>This misconception stems from poor management rather than the inherent value of pensions as a retirement savings vehicle.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Starting late is okay</strong>
        <p>Delaying retirement planning can result in insufficient savings, making it harder to achieve financial security later on.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Small contributions don't matter</strong>
        <p>Many underestimate the power of small, consistent investments, which can grow significantly over time through compounding.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>All debt is bad debt</strong>
        <p>Not all debt is detrimental; some forms can be strategically beneficial within a retirement plan.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>These misconceptions can lead to inadequate planning and financial insecurity in retirement. Understanding the realities of retirement planning is crucial for a secure financial future.</p>
